    Solace Corporation Messaging API for C Introductory Sample Programs

INTRODUCTION

   These samples provide a basic introduction to using the Messaging API for
   C in messaging applications. Common uses, such as sending a direct message,  
   receiving a direct message, sending a guaranteed message, and receiving a
   guaranteed message, are described in detail in these samples.

   To clearly illustrate the message API concepts, error checking and handling 
   is not included.  To see advanced samples with robust error handling and 
   checking, see the 'ex/' sample directory.

   Before working with these samples, ensure that you have read and understood
   the  basic  concepts  found in the Solace Corporation Messaging API for Java, 
   C, and .NET User Guide.

SAMPLE DOCUMENTATION

   For a description of each sample and an annotated listing of the source code 
   please see the "C CSMP API Documentation" included in solclient-doc.tar.gz.


HOW TO BUILD THE SAMPLES

   REQUIRED SOFTWARE

   To compile and run the sample applications on Windows systems, ensure that 
   Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition or above is installed and configured 
   on your computer. Be sure you have installed the correct Solace Corporation package 
   based on your installed Visual Studio.

   For Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012/2013 install solclient_Win_<version>.tar.gz

   For  Visual Studio 2015 install solclient_Win_vs2015_<version>.tar.gz

WINDOWS BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Visual Studio 2008:

   1. Navigate to the 'vs2008' directory. If there is just a vs2015 directory and
      no vs2008 directory, you have installed the wrong package.
   2. Open 'c_api_Introduction.sln' in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2010:
   1. Navigate to the 'vs2010' directory. If there is just a vs2015 directory and
      no vs2010 directory, you have installed the wrong package.
   2. Open 'c_api_Introduction.sln' in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2012/2013:
   1. Navigate to the 'vs2010' directory. If there is just a vs2015 directory and
      no vs2010 directory, you have installed the wrong package.
   2. Open 'c_api_Introduction.sln' in Microsoft Visual Studio, and upgrade the solution 
      to vs2012/2013.


   Once you have Visual Studio open, the build procedure is the same on all
   platforms:

   3. Change to the relevant build configuration and platform.  Build configurations 
      available  are:
	a. 'Release' for optimized build
	b. 'StaticRelease ' for optimized build with a static library (.lib instead of .dll)
	c. 'Debug' for debug build.
	d.  'StaticDebug' for debug build with a static library.

      Platform options are:
	a. Win64 for 64 bit builds.
	b. Win32 for 32 bit builds.

   4. Build the solution 'c_api_Introduction'.



Visual Studio 2015:
   1. Navigate to the 'vs2015' directory. If there is a vs2008 directory and
      a vs2010 directory but no vs2015 directory, you have installed the wrong package.
   2. Open 'c_api_Introduction.sln' in Microsoft Visual Studio.
   3. Change to the relevant build configuration and platform.  Build configurations 
      available  are:
	a. 'Release' for optimized build
	b. 'StaticRelease ' for optimized build with a static library (.lib instead of .dll)
	c. 'Debug' for debug build.
	d.  'StaticDebug' for debug build with a static library.

      Platform options are:
	a. Win64 for 64 bit builds.
	b. Win32 for 32 bit builds.

   4. Build the solution 'c_api_Introduction'.
